Topic Modeling on Thomas Hobbes's Leviathan using BERTopic

This repository contains the code used to perform topic modeling on Thomas Hobbes's Leviathan using BERTopic. The purpose of this project is to identify the main topics discussed in the text and visualize them in a way that is easily understandable.

The following dependencies are required to run the code:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
hdbscan
